## Description 

Journey Log 2.0 is a React application that uses a number of different node packages and technologies. It uses graphql, @apollo/server, react-strap, bootstrap, vite, express, bcrypt, jwt tokens, nodemon, and mongoose.


## Usage

To use this web application, first you must create a user. The signup button at the top brings you to a signup form page. Then once you are signed in you will be able to login again after you logout. When a login is created it will then show the form to create a journey. This includes a text input section for title as well as body. There are character limits for both up to 280 characters. Once the user has made a post, they are then able to see all of their posts and also make a comment on the post. Other users are able to see your posts and make comments on it. The object being, a user is going on a vacation and wants other people to comment or tell them about if they have any recommendations on what to do, things to see, what to eat, etc. Then the user is able to see all of the posts and comments when they go their profile and click on a post.
